# Contributing Guidelines

The HTEC Group - DevSecOps projects accept contributions via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines the process
to help get your contribution accepted.

## Reporting a Security Issue

Most of the time, when you find a bug in our projects, it should be reported using [GitHub
issues](). However, if you are reporting a _security
vulnerability_, please read [Security Policy](https://github.com/htec-infra/.github/security/policy). This will give us a
chance to try to fix the issue before it is exploited in the wild.
